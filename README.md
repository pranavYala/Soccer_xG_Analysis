# Soccer_xG_Analysis
# Introduction
One of the most commonly thrown around statistics in Soccer is xG, or Expected Goals. It's commonly used to measure how good of a finish a certain goal was, or how creative a team in geenral was in a specific game. It's a measure of many chances were created, as well as how well a certain player or team was able to finish those chances. Statistics play a major role in analyzing Soccer matches, with a variety of elements being tracked, like number of passes, pass accuracy, shots taken, saves made, kilometers ran by a player, tackles made, aerial duels won, and on and on. The xG statistic is one of the most important ones to look at for attacking players, so I've decided to dig deeper to find any overlooked insights into the performances of the players I love and watch almost every week.

The dataset I'm going to be using covers games from 2011 - 2017, and focuses on the top 5 leagues in Europe, which are the Premier League (England), La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), Bundesliga (Germany), and Ligue 1 (France). The dataset contains records for over 90% of the games within these leagues over this time period. For each game, a variety of events are recorded, including fouls, an attempt at goal, offsides, substitutions, and more. The dataset was created by Alin Secareanu, and is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/secareanualin/football-events

# Questions
In this analysis, I will try to answer a variety of questions that I've had, such as:

- Who are the best and worst penalty takers?
- Who are the best and worst finishers?
- Who are the best finishers with a given body part (left foot, right foot, head)?
- Who are the best and worse passers?
- Who are the best long range shooters?

I already expect to see certain names, like Messi, Ronaldo, Suarez, and others in quite a few of these lists, but I'm doing this for the players that I wouldn't really expect to show up. I'm doing this to see the underrated passers, and finishers, and penalty takers, so that hopefully, I have a more unbiased and complete view of the game by the end of this analysis.
